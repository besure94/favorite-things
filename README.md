## Favorite Things

#### By Brian Scherner

#### A simple application displaying a users favorite things.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* Javascript

## Description

This application allows a user to enter several of their favorite things. The form values are gathered and placed into an array. Then they are rearranged into a new array, which is then displayed as an unordered list.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning, but I plan to refactor code later to make it easier to read and understand.
